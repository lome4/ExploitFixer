# ExploitFixer

# INFORMATION

This is a free Spigot plugin that secures your server preventing exploits by checking packets before they are readed by the server.

To fix BungeeCord exploits (OutOfBounds, DecoderException, HTTP packets, etc...) use FlameCord. (BungeeCord with 1.7+ compatibility)

To fix other kind of Crash Exploits you will have to use forks like FlamePaper!

· Commands that some plugins have and can crash your server are blocked by ExploitFixer.
· Items are remade by ExploitFixer to prevent invalid Hacked Creative Items. (Players with creative mode can create any kind of item by sending a packet)
· Packets that accomplish certain conditions (ex: sending big book data) will be blocked from the server to prevent crashing your network. (ExploitFixer protects you from every packet possible sent by players)
